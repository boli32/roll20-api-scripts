    "description": "# Treasure Data \nThis is a script which doesnt do anything by itself, but defines the state variable 'TDATA', which are used by other programs, specifically **Treasure Generator**.\n > NOTE: You can adjust the version to either 'Wizards' or 'Bespoke' Wizards will generate all the magic items from all wizards of the Coast publications I could find. Bespoke does not include that and just autogenerates more 'standard' items. This, combined wih the ability to add Adventure items, should allow you to balance your adventure better.\n## More Information?\n [See the README](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/blob/master/TreasureGenerator/README.md)\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome!
